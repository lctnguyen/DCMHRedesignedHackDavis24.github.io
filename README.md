Davis Community Meals and Housing is a non-profit organization that focuses on "Instilling Hope and Saving Lives" of homeless and 
low-income families and individuals by providing them with housing, food, and human services to help them rebuild their lives. 
We were inspired and honored to redesign DCMH since this is a good cause and wanted both a tech aspect and design aspect, a good blend of our team.

We have redesigned their website to a more modern and simple color palette that is both eye-catching and comforting to look on Figma. We had our programming team working on a database through Python that would track their inventory in real time as well as using basic HTML, JS, and CSS to build the website.
