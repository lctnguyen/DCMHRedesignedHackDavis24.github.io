Davis Community Meals and Housing is a non-profit organization that focuses on "Instilling Hope and Saving Lives" of homeless and 
low-income families and individuals by providing them with housing, food, and human services to help them rebuild their lives. 
We were inspired and honored to redesign DCMH since this is a good cause and wanted both a tech aspect and design aspect, a good blend of our team.

We have redesigned their website to a more modern and simple color palette that is both eye-catching and comforting to look at. 
We started with research about the current website and ideas that we liked/didn't like about it and drew out ways we could improve their website before deciding on an idea
and putting it onto Figma. We had a second team try to work on a database through Python that would track their inventory in real time that would also tell people who would like to donate which items are more in need presently. 
(For fun: we had our coders learn HTML and try to recreate the website on Figma)

If we are allowed to continue working on the website, we would like to create a way for the admin and public view to be different and be able to work more on the website to include more of the original website and navs
